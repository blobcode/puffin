# 🐧 puffin

A simple single-binary webserver written in go (yay!).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need a text editor and `go > 1.16` installed

```
go version
```

### Installing

To get running, just create a post or update a template and then build.

```
go build -ldflags '-s'
```

And there you go - a full blog in a single binary!
