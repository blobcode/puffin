# 🐧 puffin

A simple single-binary webserver written in go (yay!).

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a text editor and `go > 1.16` installed

```
go version
```

### Installing

To get running, just create a post or update a template and then just build.

```
go build -ldflags '-s'
```

And there you go - a full blog in a single binary!
